# ReadRecord
This will be my first app on Android platform. Maybe fun.

This program is used to record your reading progress.  
  1. First you can add your book's infomation.
  2. Once you finish to read one chapter, you can mark the chapter is read.
  3. Then the program will calculate the percent of the book you have read automatically.
  
It's simple but useful for me.
